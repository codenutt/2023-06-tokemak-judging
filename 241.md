# Risk of Incorrect Asset Pricing by ChainlinkOracle in Case of Underlying Aggregator Reaching minAnswer
## Summary
Risk of Incorrect Asset Pricing by ChainlinkOracle in Case of Underlying Aggregator Reaching minAnswer

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

## Impact
The wrong price may be returned in the event of a market crash.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the proper check for each asset. It must revert in the case of bad price.
```solidity
 require(price >= minPrice && price <= maxPrice, "invalid price");
```
