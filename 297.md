# Anyone can steal any funds remaining in the LMPVaultRouter
## Summary 
Anyone can steal any funds remaining in the LMPVaultRouter

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract `PeripheryPayments` has a function called `sweepToken` that alllwos to "withdraw" any token from any contract inheriting it:

```solidity
    function sweepToken(IERC20 token, uint256 amountMinimum, address recipient) public payable { 
        uint256 balanceToken = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (balanceToken < amountMinimum) revert InsufficientToken();

        if (balanceToken > 0) {
            token.safeTransfer(recipient, balanceToken);
        }
    }
```
The problem is that it is missing an access control and any token will be able to be withdrawn by everyone if it is remaining on the `LMPVaultRouter` contract.
