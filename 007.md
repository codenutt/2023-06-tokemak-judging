# redeem in LMPVault lacks slippage protection

## Summary
`redeem` in `LMPVault` lacks slippage protection
## Vulnerability Detail

In the `redeem` function of LMPVault, there is no slippage protection for returning `assets`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L422-L434
```solidity
    function redeem(
        uint256 shares,
        address receiver,
        address owner
    ) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavDecrease ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 assets) {
        uint256 maxShares = maxRedeem(owner);
        if (shares > maxShares) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxRedeem(owner, shares, maxShares);
        }
        uint256 possibleAssets = previewRedeem(shares);

        assets = _withdraw(possibleAssets, shares, receiver, owner);
    }
```

Due to the relationship between `_withdraw` and `DestinationVault`, the outcome is uncertain, and users may receive less assets than expected.

There is a similar medium-risk vulnerabilitie in Code4rena: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-02-ethos-findings/issues/861

## Impact
Users may receive less assets than expected.

## Recommendation
Add a `minAssets` param and perform validation.
