# Hardcoded deadline as block.timestamp
## Summary
Hardcoded deadline as block.timestamp

## Vulnerability Detail

As shown below, in the function `swap` from the UniV3Swap contract, it is passing block.timestamp to a pool, which means that whenever the miner decides to include the txn in a block, it will be valid at that time, since block.timestamp will be the current timestamp.

```solidity
     IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = IUniswapV3SwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
            path: data,
            recipient: address(this),
            deadline: block.timestamp, 
            amountIn: sellAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: minBuyAmount
        });
```
A malicious miner can hold the transaction until maximum slippage is incurred.
