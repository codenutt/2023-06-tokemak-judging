# getPriceInEth() does not validate for active Arbitrum sequencer

## Summary

To ensure reliance on accurate data from the oracle, Chainlink suggests that Optimistic L2 oracles refer to the Sequencer Uptime Feed to verify the live status of the sequencer. This check is not present in v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/oracles/providers/ChainlinkOracle.sol 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the event of an Arbitrum Sequencer outage, the oracle data may become outdated, potentially leading to staleness. While the function getPriceInEth() provides checks for the latestRoundData() values, it does not check if Arbirtrum Sequencer is active.  For further information on this matter, you can refer to the Chainlink documentation regarding L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds. https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds 

## Impact

In the scenario where the Arbitrum sequencer experiences an outage, the protocol will enable users to maintain their operations based on the previous (stale) rates.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There is a code example on Chainlink docs for this scenario: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code 
Additionally, implementing the check could be:

```solidity 
function isSequencerAlive() internal view returns (bool) {
    (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt,,) = sequencer.latestRoundData();
    if (block.timestamp - startedAt <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME || answer == 1)
        return false;
    return true;
}

function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256) {
       require(isSequencerAlive(), "Sequencer is down");
       ....//remaining parts of the function
```
