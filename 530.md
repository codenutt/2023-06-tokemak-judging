# The extra reward token of the DestinationVault contract is locked
## Summary

The extra rewards of the LMPVault contract will be locked

## Vulnerability Detail
Taking asset storage to convexBooster as an example, the process is shown in the figure below. The requester's assets are transferred to LMPVault through rebalance, and then stored in IConvexBooster through CurveConvexDestinationVault.

The rewards of any account can be obtained through the IConvexBooster.getReward method. 

<b>The problem is that CurveConvexDestinationVault is a contract, if the extra reward obtained is not BaseAsset or _underlying, it will be locked</b>


## Impact

The extra rewards of the LMPVault contract will be locked
