# LMPVault.redeem() doesn’t conform to EIP 4626

## Summary
LMPVault.redeem() doesn’t conform to EIP 4626

## Vulnerability Detail
According to one of the rules of EIP 4626 for the redeem() function, which is ["_MUST revert if all of shares can’t be redeemed_"]
You'll see that at the last _MUST_ [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#redeem)

Now there's no check in LMPVault.redeem() to ensure a revert when all shares can't be redeemed.

It is possible that the `returnedAssets` sent to the receiver in this Ln 433
```solidity
 assets = _withdraw(possibleAssets, shares, receiver, owner);//@audit-info assets is same as returnedAssets
```
is fewer than `shares` inputted by user due to slippage, the owner not having enough shares, etc.

## Impact
LMPVault.redeem() doesn't ensure a revert if all shares can't be redeemed, therefore it doesn't conform to EIP 4626

Users can get fewer shares than they are supposed to get.

## Recommendation
add this check::
```solidity
 function redeem(
        uint256 shares,
        address receiver,
        address owner
    ) public virtual override nonReentrant noNavDecrease ensureNoNavOps returns (uint256 assets) {
        uint256 maxShares = maxRedeem(owner);
        if (shares > maxShares) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxRedeem(owner, shares, maxShares);
        }
        uint256 possibleAssets = previewRedeem(shares);

        assets = _withdraw(possibleAssets, shares, receiver, owner);
    
+        if (assets < shares) {
            revert TooFewShares(assets, actualAssets);
        }
}
```
