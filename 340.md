# Possibility of withdraw wrong token from balancer pool
## Summary
The `exitTokenIndex` is hardcoded to `0` in the `BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol` and it can cause to withdraw wrong token from balancer pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
If balancer pool is `isComposable`, contract need to call `removeLiquidityImbalance` from the `BalancerBeethovenAdapter.sol` contract. in this function, value of `exitTokenIndex` should exist and define that what token should witdraw from balancer pool.

But as you can see value of `exitTokenIndex` is hardcoded to `0` and this is wrong and it is possible that the wrong token is withdrawn from balancer pool.

## Impact
Wrong token can get withdraw from balancer pool.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
First find the index of token in the `poolAssets` array. this array is list of all supported tokens in the balancer pool. next if `isComposable` is true, `BalancerAuraDestinationVault.sol` should drop BPT index.

```exitTokenIndex = _getBPTIndex() < exitTokenIndex ? exitTokenIndex - 1 : exitTokenIndex;```
