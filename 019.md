# Inadequate Checks for Contract Validity in `SystemRegistry.sol` struct

## Summary

The contract `SystemRegistry.sol` exhibits an inadequacy in how it performs checks for contract validity. It has the potential to cause critical damage to the system by enabling the addition of invalid addresses to key parts of the system, leading to a loss of funds and complete system failure.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `SystemRegistry.sol` contract is responsible for managing various components of the system, including GPToke, LMPVaultRegistry, DestinationVaultRegistry, AccessController, and others. The methods that set these components (`setGPToke`, `setLMPVaultRegistry`, `setDestinationVaultRegistry`, `setAccessController`, etc.) perform an address zero check to ensure the provided address is not zero.

However, they don't verify if the provided address is a contract address or a contract with the expected interface. Therefore, any non-zero Ethereum address, including EOA (Externally Owned Accounts), can be set, which can lead to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

## Impact

In the event that a wrong address (not contract address) or a contract without the expected interface is set, the entire system could become non-functional or behave in unexpected ways, leading to potential loss of funds and contract breakages. Such an event would severely damage the system's operation and trustworthiness.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function setGPToke(address newGPToke) external onlyOwner {
    Errors.verifyNotZero(newGPToke, "newGPToke");

    if (address(_gpToke) != address(0)) {
        revert Errors.AlreadySet("gpToke");
    }

    _gpToke = IGPToke(newGPToke);

    emit GPTokeSet(newGPToke);

    _verifySystemsAgree(address(newGPToke));
}
```

and others.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include an extra check in the functions that verifies if the provided address is a contract and also adheres to the expected contract interface. This can be achieved by using the `code size` check to verify if the address is a contract address and the function `supportsInterface` (provided by the ERC165 standard) to verify if the contract includes the expected methods.

## Proof Of Concept

To reproduce the vulnerability, perform the following steps:

1. Deploy the `SystemRegistry.sol` contract against a mainnet fork.
2. Assume that the owner is a malicious actor and sets an EOA address for GPToke via `setGPToke`.
3. This EOA address doesn't have any of the functions defined by `IGPToke`, leading to failures when these functions are called.
4. Similarly, this can be reproduced for other setters like `setLMPVaultRegistry`, `setDestinationVaultRegistry`, `setAccessController`, and so on. 

> This proves that **the system is susceptible to having addresses set that are not actually contracts or do not have the correct interface, leading to failures and possible loss of funds.**
