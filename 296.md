## Summary
Any user depositing ETH  will have to spend double their WETH because the `addWETHRewards` function steals half of your sent funds


## Vulnerability Detail


To add rewards with ETH instead of WETH initially, tokemak supports the receive function with custom logic that changes the sent eth for weth and then forwards that weth to the  `addWETHRewards` function. 

```solidity
    receive() external payable { 
        weth.deposit{ value: msg.value }();
        GPToke(payable(this)).addWETHRewards(msg.value);
    }

```
Well the problem is the double-spending because on the  `addWETHRewards` function:

```solidity
       function addWETHRewards(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(amount, "amount");

        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        Errors.verifyNotZero(supply, "supply");

        totalRewardsEarned += amount;
        accRewardPerShare += amount * REWARD_FACTOR / supply; 

        emit RewardsAdded(amount);

        weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);   //HERE
    }

```
As you can see in the last line `weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);` that amount is pulled again from the users wallet/contract. Therefore user has to spend let's say 2 ETH to count 1 ETH in rewards.
