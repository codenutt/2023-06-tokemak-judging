# Incorrect calculation of totalAssets from the vault
## Summary  (make the full explanation counting GLIF)
Incorrect calculation of totalAssets from the vault

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling the `totalAssets()` function. The total assets are not calculated incorrectly. The total assets should be the sum of the totalIdle and totalDebt - the fees of the protocol to the sink. However, the function returns the totalIdle + totalDebt.

In this case the fees are not substracted from the total assets.

```solidity
function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) { 
        return totalIdle + totalDebt;   
    }

```
