# Incorrect calculation of lp token value for legacy balancer vaults
## Summary
 Incorrect calculation of lp token value for legacy balancer vaults

## Vulnerability Detail

On the `BalancerLPMetaStableEthOracle` contract, the function `getPriceInEth()` calculates the price of the Lp by cgetting it's totalSupply as `uint256 totalSupply = pool.totalSupply();`

```solidity
uint256 virtualPrice = pool.getRate(); // e18
uint256 totalSupply = pool.totalSupply();
```
According to Balancer's docs, this is not the way to do it for all the vaults. `totalSupply()` should only be used for old "legacy" [pools](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#totalsupply). Currently, [getActualSupply](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#getactualsupply) should be used instead because it accounts for the pre-minted BPT and fees.

## Recommendation

Do use a differentiation between balancer pools. The ones that are legacy should be treated differently than the ones that are not.:

```solidity
if (legacy == true) {
				supply = pool.totalSupply(); 
			} else {
				supply = pool.getActualSupply(); 
}
```
