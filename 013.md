# LMPDestinations.setWithdrawalQueue() will clear all destination vault addresses queued {including the new ones} whenever new list is smaller than old list(previous list)

## Summary
LMPDestinations.setWithdrawalQueue() will clear all destination vault addresses queued {including the new ones} whenever new length is smaller than old length(previous length)

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is caused by this lines of code
```solidity
 if (oldLength > newLength) {// @audit-issue if new length is smaller than old length, all destination addresses queued will be cleared.
            for (; i < oldLength; ++i) {
                // slither-disable-next-line costly-loop
                withdrawalQueue.pop();
            }
```

The `setWithdrawalQueue()`  function overwrites the old length(`withdrawalQueue.length`) with the new destination vault addresses to be queued ( `_destinations.length`) as long as new length is < old length() _i.e already existing list of destination vault addresses in the `withdrawalQueue` array_
You'll see that here:
```solidity
 // if we're still overwriting, just set the value
            if (i < oldLength) {
                // only write if values differ
                if (withdrawalQueue[i] != destination) {
                    withdrawalQueue[i] = destination;
                }
```
Now since the old length is overwritten with new length whenever the new length is < than old length, attempting to pop (_i.e delete_) old length from the `withdrawalQueue` will also delete the new length that was used to overwrite the old length.


**Here is a more vivid scenario:**
new length (`_destinations.length`) has 5 destination vault addresses on it.

old length (`withdrawalQueue.length`) has 10 queued destination vault addresses already queued on it.

Now the new 5 destination vault addresses will overwrite 5 already existing destination vault addresses in `withdrawalQueue`, which will be addresses on slot 0-4 in the `withdrawalQueue`.

now since the old length is > than new length, all queued destination vault addresses in `withdrawalQueue` will be cleared including the new ones.

## Impact
LMPDestinations.setWithdrawalQueue() will clear all destination vault addresses queued {including the new ones} whenever new length is smaller than old length(_previous length_)

## Recommendation

do this  instead::
```solidity
uint256 j;
 if (oldLength > newLength) {
            for (j = newLength; j < oldLength; ++j) {
                // slither-disable-next-line costly-loop
                withdrawalQueue.pop();
            }
        }
```

i hope this helps.
