# Incorrect Accounting of newRewards in the queueNewRewards() function of AbstractRewarder Contract
## Summary
In rewarders/AbstractRewarder.sol#queueNewRewards() function, `newRewards` is incorrectly accounted. This leads to incorrect calculation of `currentRate`  and an incorrect transfer of tokens when `safeTransferFrom` is invoked, as the contract attempts to fetch `newRewards + queuedRewards`, while `queuedRewards` has already been fetched earlier and each time this function is called it tries to fetch all `newRewards + queuedRewards` which will end in a failed transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `queueNewRewards()` function in the contract is supposed to queue a specified amount of new rewards for distribution to stakers. The function takes `newRewards` as a parameter, which represents the new rewards to be queued.

```solidity
function queueNewRewards(uint256 newRewards) external onlyWhitelisted {
    uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
    uint256 startingNewRewards = newRewards;
    newRewards += startingQueuedRewards;
    ......
    IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);
}
```
The issue arises because `newRewards` is incremented by `startingQueuedRewards`, which represents the rewards that are currently queued. This increment makes the `newRewards` variable larger than it should be.

Later in the code, safeTransferFrom is invoked to fetch newRewards into the contract.
```solidity
IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newRewards);
```
Since `newRewards` was incorrectly incremented, the contract attempts to fetch `newRewards + queuedRewards`, which is more than the actual amount of new rewards. This could potentially lead to an exception if the sender does not have enough balance to cover the incorrectly inflated newRewards.


## Impact
Too much rewards fetch from LiquidationRow leading to a DOS for all reward process if it does not have enough balance to cover the error

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, the `newRewards` variable should not be incremented by `queuedRewards`. Instead, `newRewards` should be handled separately, and `queuedRewards` should be managed in a way that ensures it is not fetched again.

```solidity
function queueNewRewards(uint256 _newRewards) external onlyWhitelisted {
    uint256 startingQueuedRewards = queuedRewards;
    uint256 startingNewRewards = _newRewards;
    queuedRewards += _newRewards;
    ......
    IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _newRewards);
}
```

OR it should be done as it is said in the description of the function and First transfer new rewards from the caller
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Queues the specified amount of new rewards for distribution to stakers.
     * @param newRewards The amount of new rewards.
     * @dev First, the function transfers the new rewards from the caller to this contract, @audit false
        // on LiquidationRow       
             //E approve main rewarder to pull the tokens
            LibAdapter._approve(IERC20(params.buyTokenAddress), address(mainRewarder), amount);
            //E Rewards are added to a reward queue, which is then distributed to stakers based on their staked balances
            mainRewarder.queueNewRewards(amount);
     
     *      ensuring that the deposited amount matches the declared rewards.
     *      Then, irrespective of whether we're near the start or the end of a reward period, if the accrued rewards
     *      are too large relative to the new rewards (i.e., queuedRatio is greater than newRewardRatio), the new
     *      rewards will be added to the queue rather than being immediately distributed.
