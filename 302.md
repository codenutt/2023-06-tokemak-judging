# Vault rebalancing is performed with stale info which will miss-calculate the idle in the vault
## Summary
Vault rebalancing is performed with stale info which will miss-calculate the idle in the vault

## Vulnerability Detail
When rebalancing, the `_handleRebalanceOut()` function will be called, which handles the rebalance by withdrawing from a destination vault and then in updates the debt and other parameters from that destination vault by calling `_recalculateDestInfo()`. It gets the latests data from the 
the mapping of `destOutInfo` which is not updated at the time of calling `_handleRebalanceOut()`. Therefore the data is stale and the idle in the vault will be miss-calculated.


```solidity
 (assetChange.debtDecrease, assetChange.debtIncrease) = _recalculateDestInfo(
destOutInfo, dvOut, originalShareoriginalShareBal - params.amountOut, true
                );
```

As you can see in the following snippet, the stale data from the mapping, will be used to calculate the idle in the vault. 

```solidity
uint256 currentDebt = (destInfo.currentDebt * originalShares) / Math.max(destInfo.ownedShares, 1);

-------

totalDebtDecrease = currentDebt; 
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The data from the mapping `destinationInfo` should be updated before calling `rebalance()` or `flashRebalance()`. This is done by calling `updateDebtReporting()` with the destinations of the vaults that you will withdraw from.

```solidity
    function updateDebtReporting(address[] calldata _destinations) external nonReentrant trackNavOps {
        _updateDebtReporting(_destinations);  
    }
```
