# CurveV1StableSwap is expected to be able to send ETH but doesn't have any payable functions to receive ETH

## Summary
`CurveV1StableSwap` is expected to be able to send ETH but doesn't have any `payable` functions to receive ETH
## Vulnerability Detail
The `swap` function in `CurveV1StableSwap` is expected to be able to send ETH for WETH deposit, but `CurveV1StableSwap` doesn't have any `payable` functions to receive ETH.

```solidity
contract CurveV1StableSwap is BaseAdapter
        ...
        if (isEth && buyTokenAddress == address(weth)) {
             slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-eth
            weth.deposit{ value: amount }();
        }
```

```shell
~/Code/solidity/audit/2023-06-tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters git:(main)
grep -i payable CurveV1StableSwap.sol
~/Code/solidity/audit/2023-06-tokemak/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/swapper/adapters git:(main)
grep -i payable BaseAdapter.sol
```
## Impact
`weth.deposit` execution failed, some functions of `swap` are disabled.

## Recommendation
Add `receive` for contract or `payable` for `swap`
