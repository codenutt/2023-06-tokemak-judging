# Updatedebtreporting prevents users from minting as many shares as they should
## Summary

Updatedebtreporting prevents users from minting as many shares as they should 

## Vulnerability Detail


The contract has a function _maxmint that controls the amount of new shares that can be minted

In this function there is a variable TotalSupplyLimit that limits the amount of new shares and vaults can have. However this limit can be bypassed with the unprotected function _updatedebtreporting. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/LMPVault.sol#L752

_updatedebtreporting mint new shares to a feesink address with checking the totalsupplylimit of the vault. If the totalsupply is > Totalsupplylimit then maxmint will return 0.

Also if shares requested is > maxmint(shares) then the function mint will revert

 This can result in scenarios where users are not able to mint as many shares as they should due to no check on shares minted to the fee sink


## Impact

Users will not be able to mint as many shares as they should

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

TotalSupplyLimit should subtract the share balance of the fee sink
