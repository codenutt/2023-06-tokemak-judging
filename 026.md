# `_verifySystemsAgree()` function can lead to gained unauthorized access to various functionalities

## Summary
The `_verifySystemsAgree(address dep)` function is designed to verify that a system-bound contract matches the current contract (SystemRegistry), it uses a low-level static call to retrieve the system registry address of the provided contract `dep.` The problem is   the fact that a malicious attacker can deploy a malicious contract and trick the `_verifySystemsAgree()` function into believing that the malicious contract is the correct system registry by returning the attacker's desired address when calling `getSystemRegistry().`
## Vulnerability Detail
see the summary and  the vulnerability is leading to the incorrect validation of system-bound contracts, allowing malicious contracts to be accepted as valid system components, resulting in potential unauthorized access or control over various functionalities.
```solidity
/// @notice Verifies that a system bound contract matches this contract
    /// @dev All system bound contracts must match a registry contract. Will revert on mismatch
    /// @param dep The contract to check
    function _verifySystemsAgree(address dep) internal view {
        // slither-disable-start low-level-calls
        // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = dep.staticcall(abi.encodeWithSignature("getSystemRegistry()"));
        // slither-disable-end low-level-calls
        if (success) {
            address depRegistry = abi.decode(data, (address));
            if (depRegistry != address(this)) {
                revert Errors.SystemMismatch(address(this), depRegistry);
            }
        } else {
            revert InvalidContract(dep);
        }
    }
}
```
## Impact

if an attacker exploit this vulnerability it's can gained unauthorized access to various functionalities within the system.
so here is an example to reproduce the exploiting of the vulnerability. 
    -  the attacker create a  Malicious code contract that can exploit the vulnerability as an example:
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

contract MaliciousSystemRegistry {
    function getSystemRegistry() external pure returns (address) {
        return address(0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890); // Attacker's desired address
    }
}
```
- the attacker Deploy the original SystemRegistry contract.
- and Call the` setSystemSecurity` function in the `SystemRegistry` contract, passing the address of the Malicious code  contract as the parameter.
the `setSystemSecurity` function will perform the `_verifySystemsAgree` check, but it will use the `Malicious code contract`, which will return the attacker's desired address. As a result, the malicious contract will be mistakenly accepted as the correct system registry.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  use an internal mapping within the `SystemRegistry` contract to keep track of the correct system registry addresses for each contract. The `_verifySystemsAgree(address dep)` function can then directly check this internal mapping to ensure the contract is indeed part of the correct system.
