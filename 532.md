# Curve related oracle's means of preventing reentrant are imperfect and may result in revert
## Summary

Curve has a well-known readability reentrant problem, and this protocol is designed to take this into account and add corresponding function calls to detect reentrant status.
There are three most commonly used functions: remove_liquidity / claim_admin_fees / withdraw_admin_fees. This protocol supports the latter two types of oracle.
The problem is that for some [curve pools](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5424b857f758e906013f3555dad202e4bdb4567#code), claim_admin_fees / withdraw_admin_fees are only allowed to be called by the owner, which results in oracle reading the price revert and not being usable.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function getPriceInEth(address token) external returns (uint256 price) {
        Errors.verifyNotZero(token, "token");

        PoolData memory poolInfo = lpTokenToPool[token];
        if (poolInfo.pool == address(0)) revert NotRegistered(token);

        ICryptoSwapPool cryptoPool = ICryptoSwapPool(poolInfo.pool);

        // Checking for read only reentrancy scenario.
        if (poolInfo.checkReentrancy == 1) {
            // This will fail in a reentrancy situation.
            // @audit For some curve pools, this function is only allowed to be called by the owner
            cryptoPool.claim_admin_fees();
        }

        uint256 virtualPrice = cryptoPool.get_virtual_price();
        uint256 assetPrice = systemRegistry.rootPriceOracle().getPriceInEth(poolInfo.tokenToPrice);

        return (2 * virtualPrice * sqrt(assetPrice)) / 10 ** 18;
    }
```

## Impact

For ETH related curve pools, reentrant detection needs to be carried out to avoid oracle price manipulation. 
However, the related function claim_admin_fees / withdraw_admin_fees may only allow the owner to call, resulting in revert, and the oracle cannot work normally.
