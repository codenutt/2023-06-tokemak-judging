# In Staking, function previewPoints() wrongly credits extra time to anyone

## Summary
Users' reward `multiplier` is based on [startEpoch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L192), which is the start of all staking time, instead of the time they started to stake. Due to this, users who stake late will receive much greater rewards than they should, because for example . Users who stake later from start are favoured vs early adopters. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `previewPoints` in [GPToke.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/staking/GPToke.sol#L183) is used by all other staking-related routines to figure out proper amount of points for a staking period. Users are eligible for a APR boost called `multiplier` which grows with each year of staking lockup period. The points are calculated based on formula:

```solidity
 uint256 start = block.timestamp > startEpoch ? block.timestamp : startEpoch;
        end = start + duration;
        uint256 endYearpoc = ((end - startEpoch) * 1e18) / 365 days; //@audit-issue everyone gets free yearly bonus, it should be start instead of startEpoch
        uint256 multiplier = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(YEAR_BASE_BOOST, endYearpoc); 
        points = (amount * multiplier) / 1e18;

```
since `startEpoch` is used, users will always have their `endYearPoc` calculated based off the start of global staking instead of the time they really staked.

## Impact
Core invariant of protocol is broken and users earn more than they should base on the lockup time. Users who stake at time that allows them to break a one year (or multiple years) from start are favoured vs early adopters.

## Code Snippet
Consider following PoC. User who stakes for 100 days earlier has lower APY than user who stakes later. 
```solidity
    function testPreviewPoints() public {
        //skip(ONE_YEAR - 100 days);
        (uint256 points, uint256 end) = gpToke.previewPoints(stakeAmount, 100 days);
        assertEq(points, 1_799_999_999_999_999_984);
        assertEq(end, block.timestamp + 100 days);
    }
```

When line is commented out:
```text
  Error: a == b not satisfied [uint]
    Expected: 1799999999999999984
      Actual: 1174728952707513266
```

When the first line is not commented and the staking starts later:
```text
Test result: ok.
```

For example, User who stakes value of `1 ether` for 350 days have `1757040831979578460` points. The same user who stakes for the same period of time but 20 days later has `1814551876122708644` points. The same amount of points is get when staking immediately for 370 days - `1814551876122708644` points. So user will receive the same amount of points by staking later, which discourages early adopters.

## Recommendation
Use `start` instead of `startEpoch` when calculating `endYearPoc`.
