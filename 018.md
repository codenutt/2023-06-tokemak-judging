# Unchecked return values on `_verifySystemsAgree` vector can lead to unpredictable behavior

## Summary

There is a lack of check for the success of `staticcall` operations within the `_verifySystemsAgree` function in the `SystemRegistry.sol` contract. If these calls were to fail, the `SystemMismatch` or `InvalidContract` error could be bypassed.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_verifySystemsAgree` function, the code calls `staticcall` but does not handle the case when `success` is `false`. This is actually risky as it could lead to the `SystemMismatch` or `InvalidContract` error not being triggered when expected, leading to unpredictable behavior.

## Impact

In case a call to a dependent system fails, the system could continue operating under invalid assumptions. This could lead to a wide array of issues, including potential loss of funds.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _verifySystemsAgree(address dep) internal view {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = dep.staticcall(abi.encodeWithSignature("getSystemRegistry()"));
    if (success) {
        address depRegistry = abi.decode(data, (address));
        if (depRegistry != address(this)) {
            revert Errors.SystemMismatch(address(this), depRegistry);
        }
    } else {
        revert InvalidContract(dep);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the case when `staticcall` returns `false` (call fails) is handled properly. 

## Proof Of Concept

To demonstrate this vulnerability, we should create a malicious contract that defines a `getSystemRegistry()` function to always revert. When this contract is passed into the `_verifySystemsAgree` function, it will cause the `staticcall` to fail. 

Here is a simple example of such a contract:

```solidity
contract MaliciousContract {
    function getSystemRegistry() public pure {
        require(false, "This function always reverts");
    }
}
```

Steps to reproduce the vulnerability:

1. Deploy the `SystemRegistry` contract on a mainnet fork.
2. Deploy the `MaliciousContract`.
3. Call any function in the `SystemRegistry` contract that triggers the `_verifySystemsAgree` function, providing the address of the `MaliciousContract` as a parameter.
4. The `getSystemRegistry()` function in `MaliciousContract` will be invoked and cause a revert.
5. However, the revert won't be correctly propagated, and the execution of the `SystemRegistry` contract will continue, demonstrating that it does not handle the failure of the `staticcall` correctly.

This PoC thus demonstrates that the lack of checks on the `staticcall` return value could lead to unpredictable behavior in the `SystemRegistry` contract.
