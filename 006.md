# Destination Vault rewards are not added to idleIncrease when info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull

## Summary
Destination Vault rewards are not added to `idleIncrease` when `info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull` in `_withdraw` of `LMPVault`
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_withdraw` function, Destination Vault rewards will be first recorded in `info.IdleIncrease`.

But when `info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull`, `info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull`, and `info.totalAssetsPulled` is `assetPulled` without considering Destination Vault rewards.

```solidity
                uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
                uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));

                // Destination Vault rewards will be transferred to us as part of burning out shares
                // Back into what that amount is and make sure it gets into idle
                info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
                info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
                info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;

                // It's possible we'll get back more assets than we anticipate from a swap
                // so if we do, throw it in idle and stop processing. You don't get more than we've calculated
                if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {
                    info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
                    info.totalAssetsPulled = info.totalAssetsToPull;
                    break;
                }
```

For example,
```solidity
                    // before == 100 pulled == 10 reward == 5 toPull == 6
                    // idleIncrease = 115 - 100 - 10 == 5
                    // totalPulled(0) += assetPulled == 10 > toPull
                    // idleIncrease = totalPulled - toPull == 4 < reward
```

The final `info.idleIncrease` did not record the reward, and this asset was not ultimately recorded by the Vault.

## Impact
The final `info.idleIncrease` did not record the reward, and this asset was not ultimately recorded by the Vault.

## Recommendation
`info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;` -> `info.idleIncrease += info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;`
