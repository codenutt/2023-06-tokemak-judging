# swap of tokens for base asset in DestinationVault.withdrawBaseAsset() will be affected by slippage due to hardcoded 0 for minBuyAmount

## Summary
using 0 as `minBuyAmount` will render the check against slippage in  swapRouter.swapForQuote() ineffective.

## Vulnerability Detail
Using 0 as `minBuyAmount` when calling swapRouter.swapForQuote() to swap tokens for baseAsset [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak/blob/main/v2-core-audit-2023-07-14/src/vault/DestinationVault.sol#L273) in DestinationVault.withdrawBaseAsset() will make the swaps prone to slippage


when `minBuyAmount` is 0 in the check below, it becomes ineffective in catching slippage

```solidity
 if (balanceDiff < minBuyAmount) revert MaxSlippageExceeded();
```


## Impact
swap of tokens for base asset in DestinationVault.withdrawBaseAsset() will be affected by slippage due to hardcoded 0 for `minBuyAmount` and the slippage check in the swapRouter.swapForQuote() will be ineffective.

IN the case of network congestion due to high volatility, far outdated prices will be used for the swaps, which will affect the quantity

## Recommendation
make it possible for the `minBuyAmount` to be inputted/specified from the LMPVault
