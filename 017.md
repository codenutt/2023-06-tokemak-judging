# Flawed asset withdrawal logic in `LMPVault.sol` permits excessive asset extraction given absence of real-time limit check on `info.totalAssetsPulled` during loop execution
## Summary

The `_withdraw` function of the `LMPVault.sol` contract has multiple arithmetic operations that can lead to an incorrect calculation of the assets withdrawn by the user. The function does not properly validate that the total assets pulled do not exceed the total assets to be pulled. In a specific condition, this can result in incorrect accounting and eventually allow for more assets to be withdrawn than initially intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

This vulnerability is primarily located in the `_withdraw` function, specifically in the loop iterating over `withdrawalQueue`. In each iteration, the contract calculates the amount of `sharesToBurn` and the `totalDebtBurn`, which are then used to withdraw assets from the `destVault`. After each withdrawal, the contract increases `info.totalAssetsPulled` and `info.debtDecrease`.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that there is no assurance that `info.totalAssetsPulled` will not exceed `info.totalAssetsToPull`. Even though there is a check at the end of each loop iteration that adjusts `info.totalAssetsPulled` and `info.idleIncrease` if `info.totalAssetsPulled` exceeds `info.totalAssetsToPull`, this check is not enough. The damage might already have been done with the withdrawal of more assets than allowed.

## Impact

The incorrect calculation in the `_withdraw` function could lead to asset misappropriation in the contract. A user could nonetheless withdraw more assets than they are supposed to, leading to an imbalance in the contract's asset accounting. This could negatively impact the contract's integrity and trustworthiness, and in a worst-case scenario, could lead to a significant loss of assets.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
...
for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawalQueueLength; ++i) {
 IDestinationVault destVault = IDestinationVault(withdrawalQueue[i]);
 (uint256 sharesToBurn, uint256 totalDebtBurn) = _calcUserWithdrawSharesToBurn(
 destVault,
 shares,
 info.totalAssetsToPull - Math.max(info.debtDecrease, info.totalAssetsPulled),
 totalVaultShares
 );
 if (sharesToBurn == 0) {
 continue;
 }

 uint256 assetPreBal = _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
 uint256 assetPulled = destVault.withdrawBaseAsset(sharesToBurn, address(this));

 info.idleIncrease += _baseAsset.balanceOf(address(this)) - assetPreBal - assetPulled;
 info.totalAssetsPulled += assetPulled;
 info.debtDecrease += totalDebtBurn;

 if (info.totalAssetsPulled > info.totalAssetsToPull) {
 info.idleIncrease = info.totalAssetsPulled - info.totalAssetsToPull;
 info.totalAssetsPulled = info.totalAssetsToPull;
 break;
 }
...
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The logic inside the loop that processes withdrawals needs to be adjusted to ensure that withdrawals do not exceed the limit at any point. Instead of correcting the `info.totalAssetsPulled` and `info.idleIncrease` after possibly overshooting the withdrawal limit, it would be safer to prevent overshooting in the first place.

This could be achieved by adding a check before the withdrawal to ensure that the amount of assets that will be pulled does not exceed the limit. If it does, the `sharesToBurn` could be reduced accordingly, preventing the overshooting scenario.

## Proof Of Concept

In order to reproduce this vulnerability, **a situation needs to be created where the sum of the assets pulled in each iteration of the loop in the `_withdraw` function exceeds the total assets that are meant to be pulled.**

1. Deposit a significant amount of assets into the contract.
2. Calculate the assets you want to withdraw such that `info.totalAssetsPulled` will exceed `info.totalAssetsToPull` at some point during the loop's execution.
3. Call the `withdraw` function with the calculated amount.
4. Observe that more assets are withdrawn from the contract than were intended.

> Please note: **This PoC assumes that a condition can be created where `info.totalAssetsPulled` exceeds `info.totalAssetsToPull` during the loop's execution. The specifics of such condition will depend on the state of the contract, such as the number of assets deposited and the number of assets that are meant to be pulled.**
